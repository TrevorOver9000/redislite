Redislite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, redis-compatible database engine. Like SQLite is to a SQL server.

An online demo can be found on http://ec2-184-72-193-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com/~seppo/redislite/

To run tests use https://github.com/seppo0010/redislite-server/ which uses redis server with redislite backend.
